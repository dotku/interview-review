# Interview Review

I'm trying to review the questions that I was facing during the interview. The answers for the questions
may or may not be the best solution, please leave the message or PR to improve them.

## General

In general, the interview consists of:

0. Resume/Sourcing
1. Phone Screen
2. Technical Assesment
3. Tech Screen
4. Onsite

## Resume/Sourcing

Either you try to submit the resume to a certain company/job board, or a recruiter come up and look for you.
It is just a way to get connect between the employee and employeer.

## Phone Screen

Recruiter and job seeker have a connection chat to get some information.

## Technical Assesment

Some company will send a Technical Assesment to filter out a certain people. It could be online quiz or a project
the job seeker taking home.

## Tech Screen

Usually a really time online pairing coding.

## Onsite

Onsite could be final round, to meet the team and have another might be more challenged coding interview.
Including behavior testing (feel about how a person behave).

> While behavior/culture fit is varied depends on the company's mission/goal. 
This repo will focus on technicial questions.
